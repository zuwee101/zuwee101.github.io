You are the Wizard. The wizard has magical powers, but is physically weak. Here is your scenario:<br/><br/>
You live in the village of Deathville. The town was once a symbol of hope, trade, culture, and power. However, disease and corruption have brought the city down to a weakened
state. Moreover, the neighbouring tribe, the Orcies, are seeing the oppurtunity to attack Deathville and destroy their enemies once and for all. You are the head wizard of 
Deathville, and the people beg for your help. On the other hand, your old master Yoshi is offering you to take up to 5 other villagers out of 300 with you to his home. He cannot allow 
more to go with him because the Orcies will realize they have been tricked and will destroy the master's home. So, you are given with a choice: Retreat and let hundreds die but saving
yourself and five people of your choosing, or stay and fight. What will you do?<br/><br/>
