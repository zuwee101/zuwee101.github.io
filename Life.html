Congratulations. You have won this level. While you have left your village and left hundreds, their sacrifice was not in vain. With your master's help, you capture the Orcies capital
city and obliterate the Orcies once and for all. As for the people who have died, your master recalls an ancient spell which can revive the dead. You revive the fallen, and sociey
is normal again. Great Job!<br/><br/>
