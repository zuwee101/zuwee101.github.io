You play a medic working in a hospital. There is a war occuring in the setting of your character. 
Many hospitals, including the one you work at, are overflowing with the injured. Although you can 
heal all of them in minutes, the spell requires a special ingredient: cookies. Unfortunately, the 
last of the cookies were stolen by the enemy team: The Cookie Monsters. As the bravest medic of them
all, you have been tasked to reach the enemy base and reclaim your cookies. The Cookie Monsters know
you are coming, so they have left only one Cookie Monster behind. However, this monster is no 
ordinary Cookie Monster: he is the Supreme Cookie Monster. This monster is asleep at night, 
and you have enough. Also, if you keep this power until the end, less cookies will be needed to heal 
the patients. So, infiltrate the base. Reclaim the cookies. Save the day.<br/><br/>
