<center>CONGRATULATIONS!</center>

You have chosen wisely. While you have died in the conflict, you've severely weakened the Not-Persians, and forced them into retreat. The people of Not-Sparta greatly honor you for
your sacrifice, and build many monuments in your honor. You are a hero in the eyes of Not-Sparta for the rest of history.
