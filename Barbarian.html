<h1>
<center>YOU HAVE CHOSEN BARBARIAN</center>
</h1>
Barbarians. You are the strongest class of them all, but lack the brains of the rest. Here is your scenario:
You are a barbarian for the Not-Spartans, and you are in the middle of the Not Persian-Greco War. The invading Not-Persians are preparing an assult on your beloved city.
The only way to stop them is by facing the Not-Persians head on, which will surely result in your death. The other option, which no one else will comply to, is to retreat to your
city and be safe from the assault. What will you choose?<br/><br/>
