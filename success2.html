Great choice. This door leads to the cookies, which fills you with relief. However, the beast is 
also in the room. Luckily, he is asleep at the moment, but one wrong move, he will wake up and
kill you. You have three choices. You may sneak up behind the beast, attempt to use the last of your
magic and take the cookies using telepathy, or wake up the beast and take him head on. What will
you do?
